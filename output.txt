DIRECTIONS: Answer the following questions in complete sentences.
“The House on Mango Street”
Think about the length of the first vignette, “The House on Mango Street.”  Do you think this length is appropriate?  Do you think adding more or having less would have been more effective? Explain your answer. 
The length was appropriate because it wasn’t too long and boring but also didn’t leave us hanging, it just left us a little curious. I also think the description of the house was just long enough and had just enough detail. We get to paint a pretty vivid picture of the house without having too much detail.
How have the characters in the first vignette had an impact on the speaker?  Give specific details.
The mother and father characters are the ones who chose the house on Mango Street which is where the narrator lives, and the nun made the speaker feel quite ashamed about her living situation because she acted sort of flabbergasted when she saw that the narrator lived in that house.
What would you say is one major topic/idea in the first vignette?  What words in the text help you come to this conclusion? Back this up with one example from the text. 
I think that the major topic of the vignette is discouragement and disappointment because the narrator has always wanted a nice home (and told stories about her family also wanting a nice home), but she is embarrassed about her current house and thinks that she will never actually have what she hopes for, a beautiful home to live in. 
What mood is created in this vignette?  In other words, how does reading this piece make you feel?
The mood of this vignette is rather sad because it talks about the fact that her family has finally bought a new home, but the narrator still isn’t happy with it and feels ashamed of it (for seemingly good reason), even though we can tell the parents made a huge effort to buy it and do it up.
Why does one title have “quotation marks” while the other is in italics? 
The title The House on Mango Street refers to the book itself, and that’s why it’s in italics, but “The House on Mango Street” just refers to a chapter in the book that also happens to be called the same name as the book, which is why it is in quotation marks.

“My Name” 
While reading “My Name,” determine the main topic/idea of each section. Explain why you think that in at least one sentence. You get to decide how they’re sectioned up, but keep in mind that there can be multiple paragraphs to represent one section.

DIRECTIONS: Pick one of the following two task options to complete. If you want, you can do both! Your completed vignette should be somewhere beneath these directions on this Doc. 
TASK OPTION 1: Vignette based on “The House on Mango Street”
Writing Assignment: Now that you have read Esperanza’s description of her own home, what characteristics of a narrative do you think are important?  If you thought “details,” you are 100% correct.  Now, it is your turn to write your own narrative.  
Your assignment is to write a description of your own home, mirroring the description in the vignette “The House on Mango Street.” Make sure you use the elements and style of a vignette we talked about earlier. You will need to write a physical description of your home, as well as briefly mention any family members who live with you. You should also describe what “home” means to you. Make sure you answer the following questions: 
Does your home make you who you are/define you?  How does your home affect your identity? Does it depict your culture?
Answers to these questions should flow freely in your narrative!
TASK OPTION 2: Vignette based on “My Name” 
Now that you have analyzed Esperanza’s name, you will write your own vignette that will focus on your name.  Below is a suggestion for an outline, but you have free rein to set it up however you want. 
Section 1: Describe the different meanings of your name.  Notice, she makes some meanings up.  You can do this as well.  Also, compare your name to something using similes or metaphors.  Use qualities that fit YOU.
Section 2: Use an extended metaphor to describe your name.  Go into detail about how your name is like this thing. Ex: My name is a bird.  It soars high above the clouds with friends and family beside it.  It has traveled the world.  It is curious.  It is free.  It is not caged.
Section 3: Give an anecdote about your name. Esperanza’s is about her grandmother because that is where her name came from.  If your name does not have a story behind it, write about an experience you have had where your name was important.
Section 4: What do others think of your name? Do they call you by a different name?
Section 5: What are your overall feelings about your name? Do you like it? Will you keep it? What do you wish it was?
While writing, make sure you are using all of the characteristics a vignette should include. Above is JUST A GUIDE. You can alter however you need.  If you want, you can talk about your middle and last name as well.
